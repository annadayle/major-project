# Project Reflection

## Problem 1: Colission

  I found myself having trouble with collision in the earlier stages of my project. I couldn't figure out how to detect if an apple was hitting the player or not. I tried doing collision without the p5js collision library at first, however it turned out to be too difficult to do it from scratch. Once I imported the collison library progress was smoother but it was a steep learning curve.

## Problem 2: Projectile/Apple spawning

  When I first added projectiles to my project, there was an issue where the apples would begin spawning on the title screen before the game began. This caused several apples to drop on screen at once when there should only be 1-2 apples dropping on the screen at a time. I fixed this using some if/else statements in the spawn function of my code, however it did take me a while to figure it out. Even in the final code, there is a bug that causes an apple to fall off screen and make the player loose a life without seeing the apple on screen.
  
## Problem 3: Levels

  This is probably the hardest problem I had, that I couldn't find out a way to implement it. I wanted there to be background/difficulty changes for each amount of apples caught by the player (ex: the apples would spawn faster after getting 10 apples or the background would change after getting 10 apples, etc). Because I was more focused on trying to make the game stable than focusing on aesthetics, the idea ended up not being able to be implemented.
  
## How Much Was I Able to Complete?

  If I'm being honest, I'll say I was able to complete roughly 70% of what I wanted to do. I had many ideas I was thinking about but I realized as development went on I was getting too ambitious and had to settle for what I could do. I had to drop the idea of levels and music/sound effects all together, even though I really wanted to implement them. If I could do this project again, I would focus on level changes, making better assets, fixing projectile spawns, adding more character movement and adding music/sound effects as well. While I do wish I went much farther with this project, I tried doing the best I could and I managed my time as much as I could so the game could be as stable as I could get it.
