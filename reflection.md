## Problem 1: Colission

  I found myself having trouble with collision in the earlier stages of my project. I couldn't figure out how to detect if an apple was hitting the player or not. I tried doing collision without the p5js collision library at first, however it turned out to be too difficult to do it from scratch. Once I imported the collison library progress was smoother but it was a steep learning curve.
