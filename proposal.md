# Proposal
I want to build some sort of mini platformer involving arrays. It would not be a sidescroller exactly, but it would involve the player being able to interact with extra objects and be able to gain points by jumping or shooting at enemies.

## Needs to have
- A life system that resets the game once all lives are depleted.
- Use of graphics for the player, background, and any other assets 
- Extra platforms for the player to interact with in the overworld (Ex: being able to hide from enemies by hiding behind or under a platform)
- Have some sort of decent looking user interface (UI)


## Nice to have
- Some nice background music (I can't compose music at all so it will have to be free to use music from the internet)
- Have some graphics be made from scratch (custom designs, textures, etc)
- Have multiple platforms to choose from
