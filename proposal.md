# Proposal
I want to build some sort of mini platformer involving arrays. It would not be a sidescroller exactly, but it would involve the player being able to interact with extra objects and be able to gain points by interacting wuth them.

## Needs to have
- Use of graphics for the player, background, and any other assets 
- Be able to have the player interact with any projectiles, as well as have a score system in place.
- Have a class for projectiles using arrays and also include array splicing to prevent game lag.
- Have some sort of decent looking user interface (UI)


## Nice to have
- Some nice background music (I can't compose music at all so it will have to be free to use music from the internet)
- Have some graphics be made from scratch (custom designs, textures, etc)
- A life system
